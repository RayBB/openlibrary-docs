This document contains a year-by-year breakdown of board reports, roadmaps, community call documents, a project index, and top-level team documents spanning engineering, design, communications, and more.

# Meet the Team

As of 2024, the Open Library program is directed by Mek Karpeles and staffed by Drini Cami, Jim Champ, and Scott Barnes, with significant support from Lisa Seaberg from Patron Services. The project enjoys contributions from volunteers spanning more than 20 nations.

# About Open Library

You can read more about the vision and mission of the Open Library [here](https://openlibrary.org/about). In 2005, the Internet Archive co-founded the [Open Content Alliance (OCA)](http://web.archive.org/web/20191230215831/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Content_Alliance) to digitize and archive the world’s books. Open Library was born shortly after, circa 2006, as a card catalog for every published book. Since its inception, OpenLibrary.org has aspired to enable patrons to access [readable digital editions](https://web.archive.org/web/20080121231120/http://demo.openlibrary.org/b/Heartbreaking_of_Genius_0) (where available) of open access, public domain, and unrestricted books. In 2007 the Internet Archive received [Special Library](https://web.archive.org/web/20150914165436/http://blog.librarylaw.com/librarylaw/2007/07/internet-archiv.html?cid=77778944#comment-6a00d8341c69e553ef00e3981f224f8833) (Rush Brandis, California State Library) [classification](http://old.post-gazette.com/pg/07175/796164-96.stm) by the State of California. This same year, Aaron Swartz gave a seminal [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQuIjwcEPv8) about Open Library and its roadmap at Harvard University's Berkman Klein Center. In 2011, the Internet Archive piloted an online [lending program](https://blog.archive.org/2011/02/22/in-library-ebook-lending-program-launched/) on OpenLibrary.org, in collaboration with several [OCA partners](http://web.archive.org/web/20110430161803/http://openlibrary.org/libraries). In 2014, the Internet Archive received a [grant](https://web.archive.org/web/20190426090129/https://library.ca.gov/Content/pdf/grantpdf/narrative-report/40-8343_NAR2.pdf) under the Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) from the California State Library system to support the digitization of books and the development of OpenLibrary.org as an online lending library service. After the completion of the grant and the [passing](https://blog.openlibrary.org/2013/01/12/rest-in-peace-aaron-swartz/) of its co-founder [Aaron Swartz](http://aaronsw.com), Open Library entered a period of hiatus, without full-time staff, and was considered for [sunset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_(computing)). The project was kept on life support in 2015 through the shared efforts of Jessamyn West, Giovanni Damiola, and Brenton Cheng until 2016 when the program transferred leadership to Mek and a [community](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/graphs/contributors) of volunteers. The project welcomed key improvements, like the “[Want to Read](https://blog.openlibrary.org/2017/12/27/a-holiday-gift-from-open-library-introducing-the-reading-log/)” button and a mobile redesign. In 2019, Open Library [launched](https://boingboing.net/2019/10/22/hathi-never-forgets.html) the [Book Sponsorship program](https://web.archive.org/web/20191104221524/https://openlibrary.org/sponsorship), enabling the community to help fund the digitization of books missing from the lending program. In 2020, Open Library invested in sustainability (upgrading to [Python3](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/issues/3333), establishing an [import pipeline](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary-bots/tree/master/BWBImportBot), and production Docker), simplifying the [patron experience](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/issues/684), and improving [discovery](https://twitter.com/borrowbot) & adoption by booklovers. In 2021, we focused on imports, partnerships, search, and becoming the Open Book Catalog for the Internet. In 2022, we focused on increasing direct value to patrons by improving the core usability and experience of the service: book page design, edition-level search, navigation, mobile, and performance. In 2023, having plucked low hanging fruit and achieved feature parity with many different services, it became essential for Open Library to clarify its unique value proposition and did so by conducting design research with its patrons. In 2024, the project is acting on these learnings to focus and align efforts to achieve a more defensible and bright library future.
