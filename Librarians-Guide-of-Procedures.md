# Authors

## Changing an Author of a work
If a work is listed with the wrong Author, a different or new Author can be set via the https://openlibrary.org/works/OL...W/.../edit edit page (e.g. https://openlibrary.org/works/OL1066521W/Caesar_and_Cleopatral/edit). Click on the Author field, type the name of the author and then select the correct author from the dropdown (to associate the work to an existing author in the system), or click the last entry in the list which should be an option to create a new record for this author.
