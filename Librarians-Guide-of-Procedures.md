# Authors

## Changing an Author of a work
If a work is listed with the wrong Author, a different or new Author can be set via the https://openlibrary.org/works/OL...W/.../edit edit page (e.g. https://openlibrary.org/works/OL1066521W/Caesar_and_Cleopatral/edit). Click on the Author field, type the name of the author and then select the correct author from the dropdown (to associate the work to an existing author in the system), or click the last entry in the list which should be an option to create a new record for this author. Please be very sure that there's not a suitable existing record before creating a new Author record.

## Splitting a conflated Author record

For author's with common names and no other distinguishing info (e.g. birth/death dates), it is common for many different authors to be listed under a single record. To rectify this, move the works for each individual author to the appropriate author record (creating a new record if necessary). When they've all been moved, delete the original record. This is one of the few cases in which we delete records, because there's no reasonable place to redirect it to.

Gotchas to watch out for:
* Newly created author records aren't available in search, so can't immediately be used for a second book. Resist the temptation to create multiple new records and instead wait the minutes or hours necessary for the search index to be updated.
* Distinguishing newly created authors can be difficult since they won't have the top subject listed. As a workaround, you can use the OLID (ie OLnnnnA) directly to select the correct author (but it still needs to have been indexed).
