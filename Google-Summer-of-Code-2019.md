Open Library (https://openlibrary.org) is a digital library run by Internet Archive which loans over a 1.5M ebooks each year to over 2M patrons around the world. We’re looking for an engineer to lead us in democratizing book acquisition by giving readers the ability to crowd-fund and sponsor the books they want in their Open Library.

There are 26M books listed in Open Library’s catalog, but only 3M of these web-pages link to readable / borrowable copies of the digital book. The remaining 23M book pages offer useful information, but the books themselves need to be purchased for the library in order to be unlocked to our readers. As an engineer on the project, you will be designing a pilot program which adds actionable “sponsor” buttons to these 23M book pages and allows patrons to fund and sponsor the books they want. Instead of books sitting unused on our bookshelves, let’s instead make the books we love available to the world!
