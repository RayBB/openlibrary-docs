We still need to build out the docs here that apply to everyone.

## Overview

Open Library is an effort started in 2006 to create "one web page for every book ever published." It provides access to many public domain and out-of-print books, which can be read online.

Here's a quick public tour of Open Library to get you familiar with the service and its offerings (10min).
