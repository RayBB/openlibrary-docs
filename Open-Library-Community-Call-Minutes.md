# Week 1: 2017-03-08 Community Call

Attendees:
- @mek, @charles

## Blocking problems

@mek needs to fix vagrant researcher VM to work w/ updated auth; login w/ email

## Discussing Q2 and Q3 Roadmap

See: https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/wiki/Roadmap

Note:
- Charles needs a bot with admin access
- Current git has to our openlibrary page (dev) -- what version are we running? (use git tag)
- @skylerbunny's PR for prioritizing oclc > isbn
- David and charles access to VM for MARC record parsing

cares about pre-1600 books

What are we missing from being a good authoritative source of data?
- general librarianship (no standard) -- standard geographical location [early books, foreign language books] -- English is the language of metadata
- supporting multiple languages (accurate records)
- allow upload on Open Library?... (to archive.org)
- ask partners for title page scans (from partners) + book covers
- Wing numbers as an identifier 
- Grouping by publisher -- use subject "publisher"

openlibrary-g works better than open library mailing list

Opportunities:
- Author merges

Let's create a button for:
[books I own | books I've read | books I want]
private lists which are private

Stack-overflow for Open Library
Wikipedia - every page [Work] has a discussion section

## Ideas
Subscribe to changes on pages
A user chat page or messaging
Badges and karma for librarians (discogs.com has this) [gameify]
- number of edits
- works added
- librarian badge
- genre bags
- how many books you've read

How do we surface the style guides for Open Library?

Standards document:
- auto validation on a title (warning of data is invalid)

Like wikipedia, have a banner which shows which pages need 
flag desired data as missing -- request a change
How can users request they want to know a field? !!!
