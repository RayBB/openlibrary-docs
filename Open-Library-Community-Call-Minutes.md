# Week 1: 2017-03-08 Community Call

Attendees:
- @mek, @charles

## Blocking problems

@mek needs to fix vagrant researcher VM to work w/ updated auth; login w/ email

## Discussing Q2 and Q3 Roadmap

See: https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/wiki/Roadmap

Note:
- Charles needs a bot with admin access
- Current git has to our openlibrary page (dev) -- what version are we running? (use git tag)
- @skylerbunny's PR for prioritizing oclc > isbn
- David and charles access to VM for MARC record parsing

cares about pre-1600 books

What are we missing from being a good authoritative source of data?
- general librarianship (no standard) -- standard geographical location [early books, foreign language books] -- English is the language of metadata
- supporting multiple languages (accurate records)
- allow upload on Open Library?... (to archive.org)
- ask partners for title page scans (from partners) + book covers
- Wing numbers as an identifier 
- Grouping by publisher -- use subject "publisher"

openlibrary-g works better than open library mailing list

Opportunities:
- Author merges

Let's create a button for:
[books I own | books I've read | books I want]
private lists which are private

Stack-overflow for Open Library
Wikipedia - every page [Work] has a discussion section

## Ideas
Subscribe to changes on pages
A user chat page or messaging
Badges and karma for librarians (discogs.com has this) [gameify]
- number of edits
- works added
- librarian badge
- genre bags
- how many books you've read

How do we surface the style guides for Open Library?

Standards document:
- auto validation on a title (warning of data is invalid)

Like wikipedia, have a banner which shows which pages need 
flag desired data as missing -- request a change
How can users request they want to know a field? !!!

## Week 2: 2017-03-15 Community Call

Updates:
1) Vagrant Fixes (auth)
2) Removed link to kindle download (broken)
3) Bots & admin features
4) Metadata prep for @dvd
5) OPDS this week
6) TODO: fixing Lists (works shows 0 editions)

Folks:
- Nicholas (ios, product; wants redesign)
- Irene (product, business)
- David (book metadata, search, systems)
- Brenton, Mek (OL)

Todos, opportunities, and blockers:
1) Getting David access to MARCs, the metatools repo, and a very short overview of the tools / process
2) Getting @nicholaskinloch and @irenem access to data (happy to do an in person google analytics session, or see what we need to do in order to get the data y'all need)
3) Following up with @charles about administrative metadata features (possibly updating openlibrary-client to have special functions for `bot` users, like work merge)
5) Following up with David re: List bug (Works show 0 editions)
6) Getting a design group together + making Open Library responsive
7) Entertaining the idea of letting users answer questions / customize their accounts (e.g. location, age, etc) to help with recommendations
8) Catching up w/ @skylerbunny to identify other problems/bugs of interest
