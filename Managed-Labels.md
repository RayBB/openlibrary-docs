# Managed Labels

*WIP: This is work in progress, super rough. Do not rely on it yet. Suggestions to @brad2014*

We reserve a set of labels for use with Github issues, to assist with issue handling and project management for OpenLibrary.

Labels are grouped by prefix and color. If you create a label outside the managed set, prefix it with your initials. We are continually evolving the managed set to meet our needs.

[TBD: full descriptions of labels will go here, duplicated from the label descriptions actually live. The current proposal is at [proposed-labels](https://github.com/brad2014/ol-bug-triage/labels).
