Best practices were discussed at http://webservices.itcs.umich.edu/mediawiki/oaibp/index.php/IdentifyingTheResource although that site has been frozen since, in mid-2007, the DLF was reabsorbed into the CLIR to form https://www.diglib.org. Not sure where current best practices abide.

# Name identifiers

- olid - Open Library author record (e.g. OL1234A, one (or more) records intended to refer to an author)
- lcauth - Library of Congress authority ID (e.g. https://id.loc.gov/authorities/no2013090983 )
- viaf id - Virtual International Authority File identifier, records federated from many national name authority files by the OCLC, with one (or more) viaf id per author (c.f. https://viaf.org/)
- isni - International Standard Name Identifier per ISO27729, one isni per author (c.f. http://www.isni.org/ )
- orcid - Open Researcher and Contributor ID, one orcid per author identity (occasionally per pseudonym, c.f. https://orcid.org )
- wdt id - Wikidata item as used for a person or identity (e.g. https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6290611 )

# Edition identifiers

- oclcid - OCLC control number (many oclcids may refer to records for one edition: use the smallest number; c.f. https://help.oclc.org/Discovery_and_Reference/WorldCat-org/WorldCat-org_Item_Details_screen/About_the_Item_Details_screen)
- lccn - Library of Congress Control Number (c.f. https://www.loc.gov/marc/lccn-namespace.html )
- olid - Open Library ID (e.g. OL123W, OL234M, etc)
- ocaid - Open Content Alliance ID (i.e. Archive.org item identifier)
- htid - Hathi Trust ID (c.f. https://www.hathitrust.org/data )
- googleid - Google Books ID (c.f. https://support.google.com/books/partner/answer/3474239 )

# Open Library identifiers on Archive.org

Back in the day, we used to connect Archive.org <=> OpenLibrary.org items using a metadata field called `openlibrary` on Archive.org and a field called `ocaid` on OpenLibrary.org (which stands for `Open Content Alliance ID` — see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Content_Alliance).

@mek noticed these `openlibrary` IDs were very stale and had not been used for a while. So 2 new fields were added (in attempt to deprecate `openlibrary` field on Archive.org). These are `openlibrary_edition` and `openlibrary_work`.

If I recall @hank and @judec informed me the `openlibrary` metadata key is actually being used in certain places within our derive pipelines — this code has never been updated to use `openlibrary_edition` and `openlibrary_work`.

## Retrieving Archive.org data for an Open Library identifier

For any given `openlibrary_edition` one should be able to use this ID pull the MARC from Open Library to confirm if the metadata matches. Or even more easily — let’s say you have a book on archive.org called… `jungleauthoritat00sinc`

And its metadata lists its `openlibrary_edition` as `OL3561303M`.

If you use https://openlibrary.org/books/OL3561303M.json it will return the json API data for that book and you can check the values without necessarily even needing the MARC
