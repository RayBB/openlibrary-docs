# Welcome

Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a global program (paid mentorship program) focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development. Students work with an open source organization on a 3 month programming project during their break from school. You can read more [on Google's GSoC website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com). The program is run by Google, which selects aligns organizations to mentor students on projects.

Candidates (active students) apply by submitting an application to one or more participating/mentoring organization. Open Library GSoC projects may span everything from writing bots to imports or organize books, to new crowd-source programs which allow patrons to fund and sponsor books they love for the library.

## History

Internet Archive has participated in Google Summer of Code for 3+ years. Open Library has participated twice (2018, 2020). In 2019, the Internet Archive did not receive enough slots for Open Library to participate and so we designed and ran our own Internet Archive Summer of Code (IASoC) internship. 

## Your chances

Typically, hundreds of candidates email us to inquire about GSoC. 15 or so set up the Open Library code base, join the community slack channel, and make contributions to the project. Around 25 submit applications. So if you're very dedicated and invest time meeting mentors and working with them to understand the codebase and the project's needs and problems, you're chances could be ~1/25!

## Sample

You can view a sample proposal template [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FkKxvI6sbi7Nj42WdVmkHwiycPR3PR_VV44cwHPCOnM/edit#heading=h.z6ne0og04bp5).

# Minimum Requirements

Your proposal should be **focused**, **thematic**, **realistic**, and **metric-driven**:

e.g.
- I believe [Theme] is important for Internet Archive and Open Library because...
- [Theme] is best measured by metric X because...
- I have an idea on how to increase X by Y%
- Here's evidence X can be increased by Y%
- Here's is my proposal for increasing X by Y% (diagrams? wireframes? architecture overview? features?)
- Here are the risks (what could go wrong)
- Here are my open questions (for mentors)

# General Advice

1. Your application **should not** just be a collection of issues. Group issues into logical themes. For instance, "my theme for phase one of my roadmap is making Open Library more accessible to people in non-US countries".
2. Ask lots of questions -- some of your ideas may be easy in principle, but hard because Open Library's code base can be difficult to work with, an issue may take longer than expected! Ask mentors how long they think an issue will take, it's one of the most important pieces of value they can offer.
3. Consider creating Open Library issues proposing features you'd like to include in your application. Get feedback from the community and see whether it's something they also value and will support.
4. Have an idea of what success means / looks like from the very beginning. How will you know if you've won? Brewster suggests one strategy is, "start with the aspirational blog post and work backwards".

# Thoughtfully Choose a Meaningful Theme

Depending on what you specifically valuable about Open Library, here is an example of what an application may say:

> The reason I am drawn to Open Library is I feel every country should have a library system. Right now, X countries don't have public library systems. As a result, I am designing a plan to increase the number of international users who visit Open Library and borrow books. First, we'll add an option to account creation that allows users to select their country and language (see issue #XXX on github)...

## What Does a Good Proposal Look Like?
A good summary addresses the following 6 questions (replace `Open Library` with whatever project you're applying for): 

1) What is Open Library
> Open Library is a non-profit website run by Internet Archive. It tries to catalog every book in the world and has web pages for over 27 million book editions. 4M of the books in their catalog is made accessible online by Internet Archive for reading and controlled digital lending.
2) Why is Open Library important
> Not every library is equal. Some cities don’t have libraries at all. Open Library is an opportunity to provide equal opportunity to readers all over the globe.
3) What Opportunity exists for Open Library
> Today, Open Library is limited to the books Internet Archive decides should be acquired and made available through their library program. But there’s an opportunity to democratize Open Library’s bookshelves and extend this power to patrons so every reader in the world may be empowered to Sponsor books of their choosing.
4) Why now? Why is this opportunity possible now (and wasn’t possible before?)
> Last year, Open Library added a Want to Read button to their website enabling patrons to tell us which books we are missing from the library. To our surprise, over 400k unique patrons clicked this button since we added it, teaching us that patrons are eager to tell us which books they want. I believe some percentage of these patrons may also be willing to make a monetary donation to sponsor the accessioning of these desirable books.
5) What does the solution look like?
> For GSoC, we’d like to test this hypothesis by adding a `Sponsor this Book` button that will show up on the 23M remaining books which Open Library knows about but have not yet been obtained.
6) What does success for Open Library look like? What is the potential impact, who will benefit?
> For Open Library, success means establishing a new distribution channel to receive donations, promoting long-term sustainability. We also hope to improve and democratize our holdings by empowering thousands of patrons to participate in book sponsorship.
