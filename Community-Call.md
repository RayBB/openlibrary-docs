## Agenda

Our calls typically follow this agenda:

1. Welcome
    - Intros for new people
    - Shoutouts and wins in the community
2.  Review unresolved action items
3.  Weekly Updates
    - Share what you did last week
    - What you plan to do this week (or ask for ideas)
    - Blockers (such as waiting for code review)
    - Leads can make sure a feature is one that the community agrees on
4.  Open Mic: A time for any additional topics, questions, or discussions like:
    - Does it make sense to use this beta library?
    - Where in the codebase does this happen?
    - Feedback on new team page

If there's a longer topic you'd like to discuss during the Community Call, please add it to the Agenda under "Open-Mic Topics."

## Community Call Norms

We want everyone to feel comfortable and included during our Community Calls. Here are a few norms we follow to make that happen:

- You don't have to have your camera on, but we'd love to see your smiling face if you're comfortable with it!
- Please keep yourself muted when you're not talking to minimize background noise.
- You may speak up during the meeting. We also encourage the use of [raised hands](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/205566129-Raising-your-hand-in-webinars-and-meetings) and [emoji reactions](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115001286183-Using-non-verbal-feedback-and-meeting-reactions-). However, be mindful that if someone is sharing their screen they may not be able to see it.

We hope these norms help create a welcoming and productive environment for everyone. Thank you for being a part of our community!

## Recording Policy

We generally do not record our Community Calls. However, if we want to record something like a demo, we will give you a heads up beforehand.

## Accessibility

We use Zoom's automated captions (live transcription) for our community calls. You can read more about it in [Zoom's documentation](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/4403492514829-Viewing-captions-in-a-meeting-or-webinar). If you have any trouble with it, please let us know.

## FAQs

### What if I can't attend a call?
Post in Slack or leave a note in the document ahead of time including what you'd like discussed or need help with.

### How often does the meeting notes link change?
Yearly, around December.

### Where are the links for the design and communications calls?

The design call notes are in the same document as the community call, to keep things in one place and searchable.
