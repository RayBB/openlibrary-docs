# About Open Library

You can read more about the vision and mission of the Open Library [here](https://openlibrary.org/about). In 2005, the Internet Archive co-founded the [Open Content Alliance (OCA)](http://web.archive.org/web/20191230215831/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Content_Alliance) to digitize and archive the world’s books. Open Library was born shortly after, circa 2006, as a card catalog for every published book. Since its inception, OpenLibrary.org has aspired to enable patrons to access [readable digital editions](https://web.archive.org/web/20080121231120/http://demo.openlibrary.org/b/Heartbreaking_of_Genius_0) (where available) of open access, public domain, and unrestricted books. In 2007 the Internet Archive received [Special Library](https://web.archive.org/web/20150914165436/http://blog.librarylaw.com/librarylaw/2007/07/internet-archiv.html?cid=77778944#comment-6a00d8341c69e553ef00e3981f224f8833) (Rush Brandis, California State Library) [classification](http://old.post-gazette.com/pg/07175/796164-96.stm) by the State of California. This same year, Aaron Swartz gave a seminal [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQuIjwcEPv8) about Open Library and its roadmap at Harvard University's Berkman Klein Center. In 2011, the Internet Archive piloted an online [lending program](https://blog.archive.org/2011/02/22/in-library-ebook-lending-program-launched/) on OpenLibrary.org, in collaboration with several [OCA partners](http://web.archive.org/web/20110430161803/http://openlibrary.org/libraries). In 2014, the Internet Archive received a [grant](https://web.archive.org/web/20190426090129/https://library.ca.gov/Content/pdf/grantpdf/narrative-report/40-8343_NAR2.pdf) under the Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) from the California State Library system to support the digitization of books and the development of OpenLibrary.org as an online lending library service.

After the completion of the grant and the [passing](https://blog.openlibrary.org/2013/01/12/rest-in-peace-aaron-swartz/) of its co-founder [Aaron Swartz](http://aaronsw.com), Open Library entered a period of hiatus, without full-time staff, and was considered for [sunset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_(computing)). In 2015, the Open Library project was kept on life support through the significant shared efforts of Jessamyn West, Giovanni Damiola, and Brenton Cheng.

In 2016, the program transitioned leadership to Mek and a [community](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/graphs/contributors) of volunteers who added key improvements, such as the “[Want to Read](https://blog.openlibrary.org/2017/12/27/a-holiday-gift-from-open-library-introducing-the-reading-log/)” button and a mobile redesign. Among these volunteers, Charles Horn, Drini Cami, Jim Champ, Lisa Seaberg, and Scott Barnes eventually transitioned to staff on Open Library or adjacent projects at the Internet Archive.

In 2019, Open Library [launched](https://boingboing.net/2019/10/22/hathi-never-forgets.html) the [Book Sponsorship program](https://web.archive.org/web/20191104221524/https://openlibrary.org/sponsorship), enabling the community to help fund the digitization of books missing from the lending program. In 2020, Open Library invested in sustainability (upgrading to [Python3](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/issues/3333), establishing an [import pipeline](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary-bots/tree/master/BWBImportBot), and production Docker), simplifying the [patron experience](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/issues/684), and improving [discovery](https://twitter.com/borrowbot) & adoption by book lovers. In 2021, we focused on imports, partnerships, search, and becoming the Open Book Catalog for the Internet. In 2022, we focused on increasing direct value to patrons by improving the core usability and experience of the service: book page design, edition-level search, navigation, mobile, and performance. In 2023, having plucked low hanging fruit and achieved feature parity with many different services, it became essential for Open Library to clarify its unique value proposition and did so by conducting design research with its patrons. In 2024, the project is acting on these learnings to focus and align efforts to achieve a more defensible and bright library future.

# Meet the Team

As of 2024, the Open Library program is directed by Mek Karpeles and staffed by Drini Cami, Jim Champ, and Scott Barnes, with significant support from Lisa Seaberg from [Ottawa IT Services](https://ottawa-it-support.com/). The project enjoys contributions from volunteers spanning more than 20 nations.

## Overview of Meetings

### Weekly Calls

- The internal staff ABC (Archive Book Catalog) Team call (1h, Monday @ 12pm PT) [2021](https://docs.google.com/document/d/146GDpF6RjTIYFksve8ic4og0xZVauSVHXQERxpLZtPI/)
- The public Open Library [Community Call](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/wiki/Community-Call)
- M/W engineering standups at 11am (20min)
- Weekly 1:1's (45min)

### Yearly Planning

Open Library does planning on a yearly cadence and involved the community in its planning process. These yearly plans are distilled into executive summaries which are then vetted by the community and ultimately presented for management and the board for approval.

In November/December, the Open Library community works on its yearly Planning Document.
* [2021](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U2zolE0q_H4ydO4ss4RvD9Tv-DJpNMs4T9k8Qxef20A/edit#heading=h.exy6eztn4j46), [2020](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gP5q0W3S2Fj5GMJMzi064CEy1zWzyl8Lzjgws-7lpt4/edit), [2019](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16rxDNLnVBbkrgzUNd2YVFheB4UtAe63Y-dX_5MHSrY8/edit), [2018](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VEoc0fMOPwrt_YKplaGO5_Q5MRye0xQtGTsTPuDrtcc/edit), [2017](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aE_0uQuCa_pHNxY_rcbpMRaNI6Nrf9KLTgGcYoQBgfI/edit), and the rest [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KJr3A81Gew7nfuyo9PnCLCjNBDs5c7iR4loOGm1Pafs).

This gets turned into a yearly Executive Priorities Roadmap which gets submitted to the board

### Monthly Milestone Planning

Each week (presently on Monday [2021]) the internal team has an ABC (Archive Book Catalog) call. On the last week of each month, during our weekly staff ABC calls, Open Library staff meets to plan the upcoming monthly [Milestone](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/milestones). This process is informed by (a) the yearly Roadmap, (b) comments from stakeholders -- including management, community members, and partners -- and (c) high priority items on our issue tracker. During the milestone planning call, we calculate a summary/snapshot of how we performed, we renamed the current milestone to `Sprint YYYY-MM` and then close/archive it, and move all its remaining items to the rolling [Next Proposed Milestone](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/milestone/33). We then create a new empty Milestone called "Active Milestone" for the upcoming sprint and go through [Next Proposed](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/milestone/33) to source issues. Each issue on the milestone must have an assignee and it must be clear to all parties what is expected/necessary in order for the issue to be resolved.

### Quarterly Review

Every three months (before the end of the quarter) we use our ABC weekly staff meeting to review our yearly planning document. This includes evaluating our progress, blockers or circumstances which may merit a change of prioritization, and communication of changes to stakeholders.

### Project-based Planning

When we have large/epic projects spanning multiple issues or individuals, we typically use a google doc to flesh out the initial idea, as well as a placeholder github issue with the `epic` label. The [Book Sponsorship Program](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ym9RRNB5_k7I7z6ZehKKn0TISYgF1yofE-rtw6NtMWM/edit#heading=h.re0jke5xmq3c), our [Migration to Python 3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VoSiTzsO3r2Qlhs5OoRFfbZR_u1ft8uR-72g_Mz175Y/edit), the [Canonical Books Page Re-Design](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DDb2VX-otD5jPMbF_6ccI_wv8nrWMpNAWSBc4kXud2k/edit), and [Community Book Tags Project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13Qrxfnd7BbSoMyRIAMM1wekr78sOVbaZpaOfH03tHe0/edit#) are four such examples. Once the proposal outline has been reviewed with stakeholders, we update the placeholder Epic issue to include sub-issues which may be added to upcoming milestones, as deemed appropriate. Each project of this size is assigned a team [Lead](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/wiki/Responsibilities-of-Leads) who is responsible for overseeing its progress and coordinating with contributors. [Leads](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/wiki/Responsibilities-of-Leads) are invited to use whatever project management works best for their style, though a popular approach is getting permission to registering a new [Project Board](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/projects).

### Long Term Vision (5y)

In 2018, Mek, Drini Cami, and Charles Horn, went through the process of high-level, long-term strategic planning. Some internal documents are available, as well as copious internal notes. We also have years of notes from previous members of the Open Library team. At this point, they have not been compiled into a single publicly available 5-year proposal. 

As it evolves, our [5-10yr vision will be documented here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q_jAcdEc705H3gsZv_Yt_08c8YFmefdSvMbiljc2O8g/edit#)

# Fellowships

The Internet Archive’s Open Library Fellowship is a flexible, self-designed independent study which pairs volunteers with mentors to lead development of a high impact feature for OpenLibrary.org.

Most fellowship programs last one or more months and are flexible, according to the preferences of contributors and availability of mentors. We typically choose fellows based on their exemplary and active participation, conduct, and performance within the Open Library community. The Open Library staff typically only accepts 1 or 2 fellows at a time to ensure participants receive plenty of support and mentor time. 

[List of Fellowship Opportunities](https://github.com/orgs/internetarchive/projects/9/views/1)

## Funding Opportunities

Occasionally, funding for fellowships is made possible through Google Summer of Code or Internet Archive Summer of Code & Design.
