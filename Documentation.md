## Open Library Documentation Guide

### Documentation Lead: @RayBB

Welcome to the Open Library documentation guide. Whether you're searching for information related to Solr or wondering where to contribute new content, this document provides a comprehensive overview of our documentation sources and guidelines.

#### Search for Solr Documentation

Our documentation is scattered but generally if you want to search for something like "solr" there are few places:
- Open Library GitHub Repo (checked in files)
  - Full text search in your IDE or use [GitHub UI](https://github.com/search?q=solr+repo%3Ainternetarchive%2Fopenlibrary&type=code)
  - Can filter for `*.md` files
- Open Library GitHub search [issues](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ainternetarchive%2Fopenlibrary+solr&type=issues), [PRs](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ainternetarchive%2Fopenlibrary+solr&type=pullrequests), [commits](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ainternetarchive%2Fopenlibrary+solr&type=commits), etc
  - The advanced UI as linked above or the general like [this](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/issues?q=is%3Aissue+solr)
- OpenLibrary GitHub Wiki, [example](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ainternetarchive%2Fopenlibrary+solr&type=wikis)
  - You can also clone this repo for local search:
    - `git clone https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary.wiki.git`
- Internet Archive's GitHub org (spanning repos), [example](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Ainternetarchive%20solr&type=code) similar to above including:
  - [open-library-client](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary-client), [openlibrary-bots](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary-bots), [openlibrary-librarians](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary-librarians)
- Google Docs (especially [Community Call](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/wiki/Community-Call) notes)
  - Not sure if there is a way for the public to search across them but Staff can
- OpenLibrary.org pages, which doesn't have an easy way to search but you can use Google filters like [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=solr+site%3Aopenlibrary.org)
- blog.openlibrary.org - for announcements and such, [example](https://www.google.com/search?q=solr+site%253Ablog.openlibrary.org)
- Some things may be buried in Internet Archive videos, which, I'm not sure how to search

#### Where to Contribute New Content

- Is it closely related to code? In the repo
- Is it focused on readers of Open Library? openlibrary.org
- Is it related to onboarding, how things work, etc? Put it in the GitHub Wiki
- Does it require a lot of collaboration? Maybe Google Docs
