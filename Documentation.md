@RayBB is the documentation lead right now.

Searching for something?

Here's your guide to finding it.

Our documentation is a bit of a mess but generally if you want to search for something like "solr" there are few places:
- Open Library GitHub Repo (checked in files)
  - Full text search in your IDE or use [GitHub UI](https://github.com/search?q=solr+repo%3Ainternetarchive%2Fopenlibrary&type=code)
- Open Library GitHub search [issues](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ainternetarchive%2Fopenlibrary+solr&type=issues), PRs, commits, etc
- Internet Archive's GitHub org (spanning repos)
  - Including Open Library Client
- OpenLibrary GitHub Wiki, [example](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ainternetarchive%2Fopenlibrary+solr&type=wikis)
  - You can also close this repo like `git clone https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary.wiki.git` for local search
- Google Docs (especially [Community Call](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/wiki/Community-Call) notes)
- OpenLibrary.org pages, which doesn't have an easy way to search but you can use Google filters like [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=solr+site%3Aopenlibrary.org)
- blog.openlibrary.org - for announcements and such
- Some things may be berried in Internet Archive videos, which, I'm not sure how to search
