## What is Open Library?

Open Library (https://openlibrary.org) is a non-profit, open source, digital public library, hosted by the Internet Archive, which lends over a million ebooks each year to its 2M patrons. Open Library is made possibly by volunteers, like you, from over 5 different countries (US, NZ, IN, UK, DE, GR, CA). We believe everyone should have a say in their library. That a library should be not only for, but of the people. Together, let's build the World's library.

## Getting Started

Participating in Hacktoberfest is quite easy as you just need to Sign Up with your Hacktoberfest and register on the [Hacktoberfest Website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/sign_up/register). Ensure you have done 5 PRs between October 1 and October 31 in any timezone. The PRs need not be in any particular Repository.

To make it easy for Hacktoberfest participants to get started contributing to Open Library, you can find a Hacktoberfest label to issues suitable for new contributors. It is not necessary to resolve only these issues for Hacktoberfest.

Consider labeling some issues Hacktoberfest, as these are picked up by DigitalOcean’s project search. 

## How do I get help?

Gitter is the way to go! The Open Library community is here to help you out in any manner that they can.
