## Debugging & Traceback

Are you seeing an error on a page? Add `?debug=true` to the url in order to reveal the stack trace

## Performance Profiling

Is a page taking a long time to load? Add `_profile=true` to the url in order to include a profile report. This will give you a report of both the front-end (client side) and the back-end (server side) load times. For a more granular breakdown of the client, follow the developer tools guide in your respective browser, e.g. https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network-performance.

## Website Performance

You can run a webpagetest via https://www.webpagetest.org/result/180907_EQ_f494162d3f798fbe574d1350cf68de89 in order to obtain a better picture of openlibrary.org's performance on various devices given constraints
