Doc owner: Tumin

This document describes the responsibilities and process of the Community Coordinator who as of 2022-02-01 is Tumin.

## Problems we're trying to solve with this role:
1. Contributors are asking to be assigned to issues, but we have so many issues that we miss them if we're subscribed and we definitely miss them if we're not subscribed.
2. Contributors have questions which are being asked and not answered by the Lead
3. Contributors are being assigned to an issue and then they do not followup.

## Process

1. We'll do a query for recently updated issues once a week
https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+comments%3A%3E1+created%3A%3E2021-01-01+
2. If someone is asking to be assigned and the issue doesn't have `label:"Needs: Help"` then ping the Lead on slack :)
3. If someone is asking to be assigned and there is a `label:"Needs: Help"` then feel free to assign them.
4. If someone is asking for help or clarification and hasn't been helped, tag the Lead on slack using their slack @handle (can be in public channel)
