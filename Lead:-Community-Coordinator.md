This document describes the responsibilities and process of the Community Coordinator who as of 2022-02-01 is Tumin.

## Problems we're trying to solve with this role:
1. Contributors are asking to be assigned to issues, but we have so many issues that we miss them if we're subscribed and we definitely miss them if we're not subscribed.
2. Contributors have questions which are being asked and not answered by the Lead
3. Contributors are being assigned to an issue and then they do not followup.

## Process

Once a week, Community Coordinator will run a query for recently updated issues:
https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+comments%3A%3E1+created%3A%3E2021-01-01+

1. If someone is asking to be assigned and there is a `label:"Needs: Help"` then feel free to **assign** them and leave a comment -- "Thank you! If you need help or more details, please ask the team @lead here!"
2. If someone is asking to be assigned and the issue doesn't have `label:"Needs: Help"` then **add label** `label:"Needs: Response"` and comment: "This issue doesn't isn't listed as Needs Help yet, I've marked it as Needs Response so @lead can provide us with more info this week".
3. If someone is asking for help or clarification and hasn't been helped, tag the Lead on slack using their slack @handle (can be in public channel) then **add label** `label:"Needs: Response"`

Each week during ABC staff call, the staff will review issues which `Needs: Response` for each @lead. The @lead will remove `Needs: Response` after the necessary actions have been taken.

Each week during Open Library community call (when/if convenient for Community Coordinator), share our win!
- how many contributors were assigned?
- how many contributors offered help but can't be assigned yet?
- how many contributors had questions?
