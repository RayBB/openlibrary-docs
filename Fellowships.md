I missed the application deadline for a google summer internship. boo!

I want to re-release my open library android application, some suggest I use compose.

However, would it be applicable to convert the open source library to firebase?

Otherwise I can release my app with an older version of the open source library, or update it and release it.

I suppose I will make it free as that is the nature of the organization.

If there is interest, I can release it open source on github. Otherwise I may just work on it myself to give me something to do during hacktoberfest.

The search algorithm was the hardest part of the app!
