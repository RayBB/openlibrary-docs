This is just a proof of concept for improving the Open Library docs.

What I've done so far is mostly clone the OL Github wiki docs and organize them into folders.

Why I'm doing it this way:
- I don't wanna mess up the docs in the wiki right now and cause a bunch of broken links
- The github wiki sidebar is so useless and search is useless there too.
- Putting things in a fresh context helps a lot to figure out what to do with it.

What still needs to be done before I want to show Mek:
- Have an actually useful page for getting started as a developer

What else should be done if we go this path:
- Fix all the broken links (vitepress detects them automatically by default but we still need to address them).
- Organize the info better.
