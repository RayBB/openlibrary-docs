## Updates

**Charles**
- Has been using APIs to create bots to address data quality
- Found a way to delete works (e.g. audio works which shouldn't exist on OL)
- Question: Will deleting a work via API (w/ editions) will fail?
- Detected bad Author merges
- Recaptcha2; wants to allow people to more easily edit

1) [Endpoints](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/wiki/Endpoints) - contributing to document obscure endpoints (seeing which new APIs we need to build)
2) Administrative Document - documenting processes & practices for merging works, etc.
3) Updating openlibrary-client
4) Cross-Linking Authors & Works (VIAF, Wikidata, OL) w/ David

**Skyler**

- Partner w/ Charles on discovering user issues and metadata opportunities

**Mek**
- Completing rollout of repaired OPDS
- Looking for designers to help w/ beta branch (separating FE and BE)
