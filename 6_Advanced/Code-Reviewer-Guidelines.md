## Pull Requests

We use `assignee` to denote PR ownership. If you are the assignee, then you should have the PR on your todo list until you merge or close it.
- **Assign yourself** to a PR if you have the time to take on the responsibilities of ownership (described below).
- **Don't assign others** to a PR. Feel free to ask someone to take ownership, but respect others' time restrictions.
- **Avoid assignee=author**. In the case where the PR author is also a maintainer, we will strive to have another maintainer own and merge the PR to ensure these steps are followed fairly by all.

The assignee of a PR is responsible for:
- **being the primary contact** for the PR author. Be polite; you're the face of the community to this contributor.
- **managing the PR's labels**. Add `Needs: Author Input` or `Needs: Review` as necessary.
- **ensuring the PR doesn't get stuck**. Avoid leaving the author wondering about the state of the PR. If you don't have time right now, saying "I'm a little swamped now but will try to get to this in \_" is better than radio silence for a week.
- **getting the PR code reviewed** either by yourself (often so) or by someone else.
- **getting merge approval**. If a PR requires a special deploy, label as `Needs: Deploy Approval` and get that approval before merging.
- **testing the PR** before merging. Comment about how you tested in the PR. If _any_ changes are made to the PR code, you will have to test it again before merging.
- **merging (or closing)** the PR.

Each Monday (as of 2022) we triage PRs (excluding drafts) and make sure they have leads assigneed so that nothing gets stuck.
