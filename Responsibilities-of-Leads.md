### Tips

**Identifying candidates.** One source for finding good, interested candidates is through the emailed issues. When you come across a user who sends frequent requests or questions about best-practices, this is usually an opportunity to find out more about what that editor is looking to do and if they'd be interested in being a librarian. Not all users who send freqent emails are good candidates, but those who send their requests along with supporting information or who indicate at least a basic understanding of bibliographic records may be.
