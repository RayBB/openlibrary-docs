# Environment Setup

If you're already familiar with Docker, VS Code, pre-commit hooks, and devtools you can skip this.

Checkout the [Docker instructions](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/blob/master/docker/README.md)
or [video tutorial](https://archive.org/embed/openlibrary-developer-docs/openlibrary-docker-set-up.mp4).

**_Alternatively_**, if you do not want to set up Open Library on your local computer, try Gitpod!
This lets you work on Open Library entirely in your browser without having to install anything on your personal computer.
Warning: This integration is still experimental.
