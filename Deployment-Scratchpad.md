Open an ssh tunnel; i.e. ssh -L 8080:ol-web1:8080 -qAy cclauss@sshgw-sf.us.archive.org
Then you'll be able to test at localhost:8080

- [ ] Open a terminal tab and log into ol-home0
- [ ] Open a terminal tab and log into ol-covers0
- [ ] Open a terminal tab and log into ol-web1
- [ ] Open https://openlibrary.org/admin?stats so that you can monitor server status
- [ ] **Warn Slack channels `openlibrary` and `openlibrary-g` of imminent downtime!**
- [ ] On `ol-home0`
    - [ ] cd /opt/openlibrary
    - [ ] sudo git checkout master && sudo git pull
    - [ ] sudo make git
    - [ ] cd /opt/olsystem
    - [ ] sudo git checkout master && sudo git pull  # -- Enter GitHub userid & token
    - [ ] cd /opt/booklending_utils
    - [ ] sudo git checkout master && sudo git pull  # -- Enter git.archive.org userid & password
    - [ ] cd /opt/openlibrary
- [ ] Repeat the same steps on `ol-covers0` and `ol-web1`  # `covers` does not need booklending_utils
- [ ] Run `~/are_servers_in_sync.sh` to ensure the three servers are in sync.
- [ ] On `ol-home0` run `/opt/openlibrary/scripts/deployment/deploy.sh`
- [ ] ~Start an old-style deploy: `ssh -A ol-home /olsystem/bin/deploy-code openlibrary`~
- [ ] Copy files out Docker image and put them on `ol-www1`
- [ ] Run `~/are_servers_in_sync.sh` to ensure the three servers have the same Docker latest.

**ADD A PIECE ON ROLLBACK WITH AND WITHOUT VOLUME MOUNTS**
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/tag
To do a rollback on `ol-home0`:
1. `docker image ls`
2. Write down the Docker `IMAGE ID` that you want to roll back to.
3. `docker tag oldev:<IMAGE ID> oldev:latest`
4. Run `/opt/openlibrary/scripts/deployment/restart_servers.sh`
5. Repeat the above steps as required on `ol-covers0`, `ol-web1`, `ol-web2`

**EnvVariable $OLDEV_DOCKER_SHA for which Docker image to use oldev:latest vs oldev:SomeSHA**

After deploy.sh finishes successfully,
- [ ] run `/opt/openlibrary/scripts/deployment/restart_servers.sh` on:
    - [ ] ol-home0
    - [ ] ol-covers0
    - [ ] ol-web1
- [ ] https://openlibrary.org/admin?stats ol-web1 goes green --> red --> green

- [ ] Browse other pages of the site looking for issues

Once things look stable and correct...
- [ ] Log out of ol-web1 and into ol-web2
- [ ] Sync the repos
- [ ] Run `~/are_servers_in_sync.sh` to ensure the repos and Docker latest match all other servers
- [ ] Run `/opt/openlibrary/scripts/deployment/restart_servers.sh` on ol-web2

## 2021-03-04 -- Deployment...
Do old-style deploy EARLY

One cover job failed on an error -- Restarting the server cleaned it up.

Troubles on ol-home because of
1. a lack of diskspace
    * Remove older files from ol-home:/opt/openlibrary/deploys/openlibrary
2. Problems with one or more PRs in the deployment

## 2021-02-12 -- Deployment...

> Check for red flags in nagios

How do I log in???

Not confident that all repos:
1. are set to the master branch
2. have no uncommitted changes
3. `git pull` works properly

Created a script in `~cclauss/are_repos_in_sync.sh` to ensure repos are all using the same SHA on all hosts

When running deploy you must enter:
1. GitLab id and password
2. GitHub id and password

One Docker image download failed so `deploy.sh` needed to be halted and rerun.

After deploy.sh finishes successfully, run
`/opt/openlibrary/scripts/deployment/restart_servers.sh` on:
* [ ] ol-home0
* [ ] ol-covers0
* [ ] ol-web1

## 2021-01-21

- `solr-updater`
   - Needed `/opt/.petabox/dbserver`, with perms for openlibrary user +x.
   - Something weird had happened on ol-home! the .offset files had disappeared :/ Seemed like solr-updater was stuck in a restart loop. Also infobase had been running on it for ~10h. Likely at some point the entire ol-home VM was restarted, causing supervisor to restart all the processes.
   - Remove the old processes from /etc/supervisor/conf.d, and ran `sudo supervisorctl update`
   - solr-updater is running ol-home0 from 2021-01-21 ; likely missed ~10h of edits or something. No clue how long the break was.
   - To check last edit + offset processed by solr-updater on ol-home0: `docker-compose exec solr-updater cat '/solr-updater-data/solr-update.offset'`
   - To get the last record/datetime: `curl -s "ol-home0:7000/openlibrary.org/log/$(docker-compose exec solr-updater cat '/solr-updater-data/solr-update.offset')?limit=1"`
- `import-bot`
   - It launched ok, but we noticed that on both ol-home and ol-home0 we were getting loads of errors:

## 2021-01-15 Deployment steps
Use the scripts from https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/pull/4395
1. __ol-home0__: Run `scripts/deployment/start_production_deploy.sh`
    * **NOTE:** Login problem with `booklending_utils` (redo manually)
2. __ol-home0, ol-web1, ol-covers__: Run `scripts/deployment/continue_production_deploy.sh`
    * Run the script only until just before the `docker-compose down` step.
    * Open `https://openlibrary.org/admin?stats`
    * Once all three hosts are ready, run commands from `docker-compose down` to the bottom of the script.
    * Check `https://openlibrary.org/admin?stats` and `http://ol-web1.us.archive.org:8080/status`
3. Repeat step 2 only on the host __ol-web2__

NOTE: On both `ol-web{1, 2}`, the command `docker-compose run -uroot --rm home make i18n` failed with:
```
ERROR: An HTTP request took too long to complete. Retry with --verbose to obtain debug information.
If you encounter this issue regularly because of slow network conditions, consider setting
    COMPOSE_HTTP_TIMEOUT to a higher value (current value: 60).
```
Manually re-running the command finished in a few seconds with no warnings or errors.

THINGS WE FORGOT:
Old-style install on `ol-home` -- `ssh -A ol-home /olsystem/bin/deploy-code openlibrary`

## 2021-01-09 Deployment steps
1. __ol-home0__: `sudo git pull origin master` the four repos
2. __ol-home0__: build new Docker image
3. __ol-home0__: docker save the image with both tags `:SHA` and `:latest`
    * Should we used date-time instead of `:SHA`?
4. __ol-home0__: rsync the :SHA-tagged image to ol-web{1,2}, ol-covers
5. __ol-web{1,2}, ol-covers__: docker image prune && docker load the image with both tags `:SHA` and `:latest`
6. __ol-home0__: rsync the four repos to ol-web{1,2}, ol-covers
7. __all hosts__: docker-compose up the appropriate docker services for that host

---

When `start_production_deploy.sh` is run on `ol-home0` it should achieve steps 1. thru 4. above.
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/wiki/Deployment-Scratchpad

# This script must be run on ol-home0 to start a new deployment.

if [[ ${HOSTNAME:-$HOST} != "ol-home0" ]]; then

## 2021-01-07 Deploy

THINGS WE FORGOT:

1. To down/up infobase:

```sh
export COMPOSE_FILE="docker-compose.yml:docker-compose.production.yml"
docker-compose down
docker volume rm openlibrary_ol-vendor openlibrary_ol-build openlibrary_ol-nodemodules
HOSTNAME="$HOSTNAME" docker-compose up -d --no-deps infobase infobase_nginx affiliate-server
```

2. To check for new errors on Sentry 😅

---

1. [ ] @mek Modify fabfile to rsync ol code repos to the new servers in their expected directories
```sh
cp ol-home:/deploy/latest/opt/openlibrary ol-web1:/opt/openlibrary
```
2. [ ] @mek Run old-style deploy from ol-home
```sh
ssh -A ol-home
/olsystem/bin/deploy-code openlibrary
```

2. [ ] @mek Checkout infogami 7595ae7 on ol-home

---

3. [x] @cclauss ol-home0 pull latest code of all repo
4. [x] @cclauss ol-home0 build the image \*1
```sh
export COMPOSE_FILE="docker-compose.yml:docker-compose.production.yml"
docker-compose build --pull web
docker-compose run -uroot --rm home make i18n
```

4. [x] @cclauss Create /opt/olimages for everything 
    - [x] ol-web1
    - [x] ol-web2
    - [x] ol-covers0
    - [x] @cdrini ol-home0

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /opt/olimages
sudo chown root:staff /opt/olimages
sudo chmod g+w /opt/olimages
sudo chmod g+s /opt/olimages
```

5. [x] @cdrini Docker save image
```sh
cd /opt/openlibrary
docker image prune # Not necessary; but cleanup
echo "FROM oldev:latest" | docker build -t "oldev:$(git rev-parse HEAD)" -

cd /opt/olimages

time docker save oldev:latest | gzip > oldev_latest.tar.gz \*2
# ~3 min, final file 820 MB ; image in docker container ls was 2.6 GB
```

6. [x] ~Modify fabfile to~ rsync docker image to all the hosts 

```sh
cd /opt/olimages
# each takes ~18s
time rsync -a --no-owner --group --verbose oldev_latest.tar.gz "ol-web1:/opt/olimages/"
time rsync -a --no-owner --group --verbose oldev_latest.tar.gz "ol-web2:/opt/olimages/"
time rsync -a --no-owner --group --verbose oldev_latest.tar.gz "ol-covers0:/opt/olimages/"
```

6. [x] Do old style deploy using mek's code so that it doesn't try to rsync to ol-web{1,2} ol-covers0 ol-home0 \*4
    - Put mek's fabfile.py changes into `fab_file_changes.diff`


```sh
ssh -A ol-home
/olsystem/bin/deploy-code openlibrary
```

6. [x web1, x web2, x covers0] @cclauss git pull latest code

```sh
cd /opt/olsystem                    && sudo git pull origin master
cd /opt/booklending_utils           && sudo git pull origin master
cd /opt/openlibrary                 && sudo git pull origin master
cd /opt/openlibrary/vendor/infogami && sudo git pull origin master
cd /opt/openlibrary
```

7. [x web1, x web2, x covers0] docker load on all hosts \*3
    - The new docker image should have label "SHA" as well as "latest"
```sh
# ~2min
time docker image prune

# ~4min
time docker load < /opt/olimages/oldev_latest.tar.gz

cd /opt/openlibrary
echo "FROM oldev:latest" | docker build -t "oldev:$(git rev-parse HEAD)" -
```

### for node in ol-web{1,2} ol-covers0
7. [x] Down / up
```sh
export COMPOSE_FILE="docker-compose.yml:docker-compose.production.yml"
# WARNING! Moment of downtime 😬 
docker-compose down
docker volume rm openlibrary_ol-vendor openlibrary_ol-build openlibrary_ol-nodemodules
HOSTNAME="$HOSTNAME" docker-compose up -d --scale covers=2 covers_nginx memcached
```

```sh
export COMPOSE_FILE="docker-compose.yml:docker-compose.production.yml"
docker-compose down
# Remove these because they contain stale copies of the build/vendor/nodemodules files.
# Want to use the files inside the docker image since it's freshly built.
# NOTE: longer term, we likely don't want these volume mounted for production
docker volume rm openlibrary_ol-vendor openlibrary_ol-build openlibrary_ol-nodemodules
docker-compose run -uroot --rm home make i18n
HOSTNAME="$HOSTNAME" docker-compose up --no-deps -d web
```

### Notes

1. Hit a docker error: `ERROR: Couldn't connect to docker daemon` . Was not in docker group

```
# Make sure you're in the docker group, to avoid sudo-ing all the docker commands
sudo usermod -aG docker USER_NAME
# Exit/re-enter to take effect
```

2. We might want a date-based instead of SHA-based image label, so that this is more human-readable (maybe `date +%Y-%m-%dT%H%M`)

3. It looks like `docker load` reloads all the layers!

Here is `docker image ls` before:

```
drini@ol-web1:/opt/olimages$ docker image ls
REPOSITORY           TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE

4. TODO for @cdrini: Remove all refs to ol-solr2 in olsystem

## 2020-12-10 Deploy

THINGS I FORGOT TO DO:
- `docker-compose run -uroot --rm home make i18n` (Added after-the-fact)

1. [x] On web{1,2} chown /booklending_utils
```sh
sudo chown 999:staff -R /opt/booklending_utils
sudo chmod g+w -R /opt/booklending_utils
sudo find /opt/booklending_utils -type d -exec chmod g+s {} \;
```

2. [x] Do a classic deploy so that ol-www1 has up-to-date static files
    - [x] Confirm web{3,4} not restarted

### for node in web{1,2}:
1. [x, x] Down
(down first so code in memory that's currently running is not out-of-sync with what's on the filesystem)
```sh
export COMPOSE_FILE="docker-compose.yml:docker-compose.production.yml"
docker-compose down
```

2. [x, x] Checkout
```sh
cd /opt/olsystem
git pull origin master
cd /opt/openlibrary
git pull origin master
cd /opt/openlibrary/vendor/infogami
git pull origin master
cd /opt/booklending_utils
git pull origin master
```

3. [x, x] Build
```sh
export COMPOSE_FILE="docker-compose.yml:docker-compose.production.yml"
docker-compose build --pull web
docker-compose run -uroot --rm home make i18n
```

4. [x, x] Restart
```sh
export COMPOSE_FILE="docker-compose.yml:docker-compose.production.yml"
HOSTNAME=$HOSTNAME PYENV_VERSION=3.8.6 docker-compose up -d --no-deps web
```

Sort of issue? On web2, got a weird issue; `git pull origin master` was not pulling that latest infogami. We think this is because of some odd funny business with .git and /openlibrary (which contains .git) being mounted.
  - **Seems like I forgot the COMPOSE_FILE**

---

Note: need to build to JS and everything else as well!

What is the status of https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/issues/2032 ?

Option:
1) Merge your olsystem PR, and test running the old deploy code (should do checkout on all the nodes)
>> 2) Manually do it


Option:
1) Try to docker save/load, and only build on ol-home
   - If we didn't mount /openlibrary...
>> 2) Do it manually


ol-www1 is what serves static files, so we need a way to build the js/css/components (inside docker), and then copy the files over to ol-www1




Creates a tar:
docker save oldev:latest

??? Get to the other servers

docker load oldev.tar oldev:14f
docker tag oldev:14f latest
