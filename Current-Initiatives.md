With a complicated project, it's always hard to be sure where to get involved. This page attempts to help you with that! Here are several focus areas OpenLibrarians are currently taking on.

# The great lintathon!

We are currently making use of various tools to lint Python, JS and CSS to improve code consistency, shared understanding and maintainability.

# Responsive and Mobile

More and more people are accessing the web using mobile devices, but OpenLibrary.org is not optimised for mobile.

There are several key problems
* CSS is huge
* JS is render blocking
* Certain pages do not have a `viewport` tag.

We are working towards fixing this by making use of a `v2` parameter in our templates which moves JS to the bottom of the page, adds the viewport tag and helps us improve our CSS.

The end result should be a more mobile friendly (and performant website)

# Docker

Lots of developers joining the OpenLibrary project are having trouble getting up and running locally in such a way that they can build, test and submit patches.

We want to improve the experience here, to make it easier for new developers to join and contribute to the project.
