I am trying to run this graph neural network code from github on my google colab. When I run the train.py file it gives me this error: from gcn.utils import * ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'gcn.utils'

I ran !python3 /content/drive/MyDrive/GNN/gcn/setup.py install - the setup file and installed gcn as well - !pip install gcn also made sure the directory was pointed to the right address.

What else can I do?
