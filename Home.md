# APIs & Client Libraries

Are you a researcher or developer looking to use Open Library data or APIs in your research experiment?
[Open Library's APIs and Data Dumps](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) is a great place to start!

You might also consider trying the [openlibrary-client](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary-client) python tool which provides convenient methods for downloading book, author, list, and subject data.
