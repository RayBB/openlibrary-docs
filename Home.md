Welcome! Open Library and its millions of readers are so grateful you're here!

## What is Open Library?

Open Library (https://openlibrary.org) is a non-profit, open source, digital public library, hosted by the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org). Open Library is made possible by volunteers, like you, from over 8 different countries (US, NL, NZ, IN, UK, DE, GR, CA). We believe everyone should have a say in their library. Together, let's build the World's library.

# APIs & Client Libraries

Are you a researcher or developer looking to use Open Library data or APIs in your research experiment?
[Open Library's APIs and Data Dumps](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) is a great place to start!

You might also consider trying the [openlibrary-client](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary-client) python tool which provides convenient methods for downloading book, author, list, and subject data.
