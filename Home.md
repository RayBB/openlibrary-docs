## Welcome!

Open Library and its ~1.5M~ 2M readers are so grateful you're here!

## What is Open Library?

Open Library (https://openlibrary.org) is a non-profit, open source, digital public library, hosted by the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org), which lends over ~1~ 2 million ebooks each year to its 2M patrons. Open Library is made possible by volunteers, like you, from over 8 different countries (US, NL, NZ, IN, UK, DE, GR, CA). We believe everyone should have a say in their library. That a library should be not only for, but of the people. Together, let's build the World's library.
