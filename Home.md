This document is the entry point for software developers who are interested in contributing to the Open Library codebase.

## What is Open Library?

Open Library (https://openlibrary.org) is a non-profit, open source, digital public library, hosted by the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org). Open Library is made possible by volunteers, like you, from over 8 different countries (US, NL, NZ, IN, UK, DE, GR, CA). We believe everyone should have a say in their library. Together, let's build the World's library.

## Getting Involved

* If you have a 1-off question, ask on [gitter](https://gitter.im/theopenlibrary/Lobby)

## Getting Started

The best way to begin is to follow Open Library's [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for developers. This guide explains [how to set up your developer environment](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/tree/master/docker#welcome-to-the-docker-installation-guide-for-open-library-developers), [How We Use Git: Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/wiki/Git-Cheat-Sheet), and how to [find good first issues](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Needs%3A+Help%22+label%3A%22Good+First+Issue%22) to work on.

# APIs & Client Libraries

Are you a researcher or developer looking to use Open Library data or APIs in your research experiment?
[Open Library's APIs and Data Dumps](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) is a great place to start!

You might also consider trying the [openlibrary-client](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary-client) python tool which provides convenient methods for downloading book, author, list, and subject data.
