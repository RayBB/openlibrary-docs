## Welcome!

Open Library and its ~1.5M~ 2M readers are so grateful you're here!

## What is Open Library?

Open Library (https://openlibrary.org) is a non-profit, open source, digital public library, hosted by the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org), which lends over 1 million ebooks each year to its 2M patrons. Open Library is made possible by volunteers, like you, from over 5 different countries (US, NZ, IN, UK, DE, GR, CA). We believe everyone should have a say in their library. That a library should be not only for, but of the people. Together, let's build the World's library.

## SMART Goals for the Open library Re-Design

In progress:
1. Specific. What will the goal accomplish? How and why will it be accomplished? 
2. Measurable. How will you measure whether or not the goal has been reached (list at least two
indicators)?
3. Achievable. Is it possible? Have others done it successfully? Do you have the necessary knowledge,
skills, abilities, and resources to accomplish the goal? Will meeting the goal challenge you without
defeating you? 
4. Results-focused. What is the reason, purpose, or benefit of accomplishing the goal? What is the
result (not activities leading up to the result) of the goal?
5. Time-bound. What is the established completion date and does that completion date create a practical
sense of urgency?
