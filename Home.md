- Tuesday Community Calls. There's also a digital meeting every Tuesday @ 10:30am PST where everyone checks in and touches base. The link for that call is: https://zoom.us/j/850313890
- Friday lunches at Internet Archive's HQ at 300 Funston in SF Inner Richmond.

## SMART Goals for the Open library Re-Design

In progress:
1. Specific. What will the goal accomplish? How and why will it be accomplished? 
2. Measurable. How will you measure whether or not the goal has been reached (list at least two
indicators)?
3. Achievable. Is it possible? Have others done it successfully? Do you have the necessary knowledge,
skills, abilities, and resources to accomplish the goal? Will meeting the goal challenge you without
defeating you? 
4. Results-focused. What is the reason, purpose, or benefit of accomplishing the goal? What is the
result (not activities leading up to the result) of the goal?
5. Time-bound. What is the established completion date and does that completion date create a practical
sense of urgency?
